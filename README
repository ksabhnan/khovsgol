Khövsgöl
========

Khövsgöl is yet another easy-to-use, fast, flexible music player and
library/playlist organizer that can handle even very large music libraries with
ease. If you're a demanding minimalist -- like the author -- you will love
Khövsgöl.

Ready-made Ubuntu packages for Khövsgöl are available at this repository:

==================
Build Dependencies
==================

You can install the build dependencies for Ubuntu via these make targets:

 "sudo make dependencies.quantal"
   Installs build dependencies for Ubuntu 12.10 (and above?).

 "sudo make dependencies.precise"
   Installs build dependencies for Ubuntu 12.04.
  
For other distributions, take a look at the "dependencies.mk" file and find the
equivalent packages.

Note that if you are building inside a pbuilder environment, build dependencies
will be automatically installed for you.

=================
Building Khövsgöl
=================

These essential make targets are supported:

 "make all"
 "make clean"

Binaries will be in the "bin" directory.

You can also build individual components via these targets:

 "make khovsgol"
 "make khovsgold"
 "make khovsgolr"
 "make khovsgolc"

To see only the C code output by the Vala compiler, use these targets:

 "make all.ccode"
 "make khovsgol.ccode"
 "make khovsgold.ccode"
 "make khovsgolr.ccode"
 "make khovsgolc.ccode"
   Outputs the C code for a component into the "c/<component>" directory.

===================
Installing Khövsgöl
===================

There is no "make install" target, but you can do a test install for your user
with these special targets:

 "make install.user"
   Installs a ".desktop" file and icons for the current user to run Khövsgöl
   directly from the build's "bin" directory. DO NOT USE SUDO FOR THIS MAKE
   TARGET!

 "make uninstall.user"
   Undoes the above.

=======================
Ubuntu/Debian Packaging
=======================

Build and package for Ubuntu using these targets:

 "make deb"
   Creates Debian binary packages for Ubuntu.

 "make dsc"
   Creates Debian source packages for Ubuntu.

Set DEBSIGN_KEYID in order to sign the packages and the ".changes" files,
e.g.:

 "make deb DEBSIGN_KEYID=12345678"

All resulting files (".deb", ".dsc", ".changes", etc.) will be in the "debian"
directory. To clean them out:

  "make debian.clean"

To build using a pbuilder environment:

 "make deb.pbuilder"
   Same as "deb", but for the pbuilder environment.

Note that when using pbuilder all build dependencies will be automatically
installed.

========================
pbuilder in Ubuntu 12.04
========================

If you have an Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) pbuilder environment, you need to add
extra repositories for the build requirements. To do this, make sure the
following line is in your "~/.pbuilderrc" file:

OTHERMIRROR="deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/vala-team/ppa/ubuntu precise main | deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gstreamer-developers/ppa/ubuntu precise main"

You additionally need to add the keys for these repositories to APT. The
following commands should do it:

sudo pbuilder --login --save-after-login
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 7DAAC99C
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 051D8B58
exit
sudo pbuilder --update --override-config

==================
Debugging Khövsgöl
==================

Useful run options:

 "khovsgold --console"
   Outputs colorized log messages to the console.

 "GST_DEBUG=2 khovsgold"
   Set a GStreamer debug level, which will output colorized log messages to
   the console.

 "G_DEBUG=fatal_warnings gdb khovsgol"
   Breakpoint on logged warnings.

# Standards-Version:
#
#  To find the max version supported locally: "apt-get install debian-policy"
#  and then browse to
#  "file:///usr/share/doc/debian-policy/policy.html/index.html". The version
#  will be at the bottom of the page. Only the first three version fields are
#  normally specified here.
#
# debhelper version:
#
#  Use "man debhelper" to find the recommended compatibility version to use
#  locally. This version must be specified in the "debian/compat" file, but here
#  we will add a build dependency for it.
#
# Other package versions:
#
#  Use "apt-cache info" to find their local versions.
#
# Missing build dependencies for Ubuntu 12.04 (precise):
#
#  valac-0.18:
#   "add-apt-repository ppa:vala-team"
#
#  libgstreamer1.0-dev:

Description: Khövsgöl Music Player: Server
 Khövsgöl can handle very large collections of music with ease. Minimalists will
 love its straightforward, clutter-free user interface.
 .
 In addition to working as a regular desktop player, Khövsgöl can work in
 client/server mode, allowing you to broadcast and share music over a local
 network.
 .
 Though designed with the GNOME desktop and Unity shell in mind, it supports any
 GTK+ environment and a wide range of audio technologies. It also comes with a
 command line interface, and a web interface is under development and should be
 released soon.
